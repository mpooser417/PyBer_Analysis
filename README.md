In order to better service and expand this large customer base, it's important to compare the experiences riders in differnt cities and cities types have.

The summary included Number of Rides, Number of Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride and Average Fare per Driver and was determined for urban, suburban and rural citites. The total weekly fares for each city type was determined by the total fares earned for every week in 2019.
